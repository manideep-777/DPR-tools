# Dependencies: 19, 9, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the DPR form page in the Next.js frontend with tabbed sections for entrepreneur details, business details, product/service, market analysis, financial details, staffing, and timeline.
# Details:
Create the form component with tabbed sections. Use React Hook Form to manage the form state and validation. Integrate with the backend API endpoints to create, update, and retrieve form data. Implement auto-save functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Fill out the DPR form with valid and invalid data. Verify that the form is validated correctly and that the data is saved and retrieved successfully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create DPR form component with tabbed sections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main DPR form component using Next.js, structuring it with tabbed sections for different data categories.
### Details:
Use a UI library like Material UI or Ant Design to create the tabbed interface. Each tab should represent a section of the DPR form (entrepreneur details, business details, etc.).

## 2. Manage form state with React Hook Form [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Integrate React Hook Form to manage the form state and handle user input for all fields in the DPR form.
### Details:
Set up React Hook Form with appropriate default values and register all form fields. Implement form submission handling.

## 3. Implement form validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Implement client-side validation for all form fields using React Hook Form's validation capabilities.
### Details:
Define validation rules for each field (e.g., required, email format, number range). Display appropriate error messages to the user.

## 4. Integrate with backend API to create form data [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Connect the form to the `/form/create` API endpoint to submit new DPR form data to the backend.
### Details:
Use `axios` or `fetch` to send a POST request to the `/form/create` endpoint with the form data. Handle success and error responses.

## 5. Integrate with backend API to update form data [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Connect the form to the `/form/{form_id}` API endpoint (PUT) to update existing DPR form data in the backend.
### Details:
Use `axios` or `fetch` to send a PUT request to the `/form/{form_id}` endpoint with the updated form data. Handle success and error responses.

## 6. Integrate with backend API to retrieve form data [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.10
### Description: Connect the form to the `/form/{form_id}` API endpoint (GET) to retrieve existing DPR form data from the backend and populate the form.
### Details:
Use `axios` or `fetch` to send a GET request to the `/form/{form_id}` endpoint. Populate the form fields with the retrieved data.

## 7. Implement auto-save functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.5
### Description: Implement auto-save functionality to automatically save the form data to the backend periodically.
### Details:
Use `setInterval` or a similar mechanism to trigger a save operation every few minutes. Store the form data in the backend using the update API endpoint.
