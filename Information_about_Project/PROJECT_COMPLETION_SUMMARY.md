‚úÖ Not generic AI tool‚Äîspecifically addresses 18L AP MSMEs' documented pain (75% loan rejection rate, 4-6 weeks, ‚Çπ15-50K consultant barrier)

### For Innovation (25%):
‚úÖ Unique combination: bilingual + cost-optimized + government-ready + no consultant dependency

### For Feasibility (20%):
‚úÖ Proven tech stack, cost model demonstrates economics, architecture scales without rebuild

### For Implementation (15%):
‚úÖ Team understands complexity: phases, validation, feedback loops, risk mitigation

### For Impact (15%):
‚úÖ Quantified outcomes: ‚Çπ50L credit immediate, ‚Çπ50K+ crore at scale, 1M+ jobs, government alignment

## üìù Documentation Quality

**Before Optimization**:
- PRD was technically sound but didn't explicitly address evaluation criteria
- Innovation advantages were implicit, not articulated
- Scaling proof was lacking
- Impact projections were general

**After Optimization**:
- Each evaluation criterion directly addressed with evidence
- Innovation advantages explicitly highlighted
- Scaling architecture detailed with cost models
- Impact quantified with measurement framework
- Total document growth: 593 ‚Üí 1,100+ lines

---
