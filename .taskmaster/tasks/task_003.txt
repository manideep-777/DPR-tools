# Task ID: 3
# Title: Define Prisma schema for database tables
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) based on the provided database schema in the PRD, including tables for users, user_profiles, dpr_forms, and related entities.
# Details:
Define the models for each table, including data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships. Ensure the schema accurately reflects the database structure described in the PRD. Refer to the provided table schemas for column definitions.

# Test Strategy:
Use Prisma Migrate to create the database tables based on the schema. Verify that the tables are created with the correct columns and data types in the PostgreSQL database.

## 4. Define relationships between Prisma models [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

Define the one-to-one relationship between `User` and `UserProfile`, and the one-to-many relationship between `User` and `DprForms` using the `relation` attribute in `schema.prisma`. Ensure referential integrity is maintained.
