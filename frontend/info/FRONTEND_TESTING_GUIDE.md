## Troubleshooting üîß

### Issue: Form doesn't load
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for errors. Ensure backend is running on port 8000.

### Issue: Can't save sections
**Solution**: 
1. Check if you're logged in
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Ensure you've filled required fields (marked with *)

### Issue: Auto-save not working
**Solution**: Wait 30 seconds after making changes. You should see a toast notification.

### Issue: Can't see forms on dashboard
**Solution**: 
1. Refresh the dashboard page
2. Check if you're logged in with the correct account
3. Try creating a new form

### Issue: TypeScript errors in console
**Solution**: These are expected warnings from `z.coerce.number()`. They don't affect functionality.

## Direct URLs for Testing üîó

- **Login**: http://localhost:3000/login
- **Register**: http://localhost:3000/register
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **Form Editor**: http://localhost:3000/form/[id] (replace [id] with actual form ID)

## Backend API Endpoints Being Used üîå

Your frontend is now calling these backend endpoints:

1. **POST** `/api/auth/register` - Create account
2. **POST** `/api/auth/login` - Login
3. **POST** `/api/form/create` - Create new form
4. **GET** `/api/form/{id}` - Fetch form data
5. **PUT** `/api/form/{id}/section/{section}` - Save section
6. **GET** `/api/form/user/forms` - Get all user forms
7. **POST** `/api/financial/{id}/calculate` - Calculate projections (coming soon in frontend)

## Next Steps After Testing ‚è≠Ô∏è

Once basic form functionality is tested:

1. ‚úÖ Integrate financial projection generation button
2. ‚úÖ Display financial results in a dedicated page/modal
3. ‚úÖ Add form completion status indicators
4. ‚úÖ Add form validation error messages
5. ‚úÖ Add ability to delete forms
6. ‚úÖ Add PDF export functionality

1. Browser console (F12) for errors
2. Backend terminal for API errors
