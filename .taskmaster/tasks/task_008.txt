# Title: Implement DPR form creation API endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the `/form/create` endpoint in the FastAPI backend to allow users to create new DPR forms. Store the form data in the `dpr_forms` table.
# Details:
Implement the endpoint using FastAPI. Validate user input. Create a new record in the `dpr_forms` table using Prisma. Return the ID of the newly created form.

# Test Strategy:
Send a POST request to `/form/create` with valid form data and a JWT token. Verify that a new record is created in the `dpr_forms` table and the form ID is returned.
