## ü§ñ AI Integration (Gemini API)

### How It Works:

1. **User completes form** ‚Üí Frontend sends form data to backend
2. **Backend receives data** ‚Üí Extracts business details, sector, investment, location
3. **Backend constructs prompts** for each section:
   - "Write a professional executive summary for a [sector] business in [location] with ‚Çπ[investment] investment..."
   - "Analyze market potential for [product] in [location] sector..."
   - "Identify risks for a [sector] business and suggest mitigation strategies..."
4. **Backend calls Gemini API** ‚Üí Sends prompt, receives AI-generated text
5. **Backend stores content** ‚Üí Saves to `generated_content` table
6. **Frontend displays content** ‚Üí User can review, edit, regenerate

---

### Example Prompts:

**Executive Summary Prompt**:
```
Write a 200-word professional executive summary for a business plan with these details:
- Business Name: [name]
- Sector: [sector]
- Investment: ‚Çπ[amount]
- Location: [city]
- Product: [description]
- Target Market: [customers]
```

**Market Analysis Prompt**:
```
Write a 300-word market analysis for a [sector] business in [location]:
- Current market size
- Growth potential
- Competition overview
- Customer demand trends
- Market entry barriers
```

## üßÆ Financial Modeling Logic

### Input Data (from form):
- Total investment: ‚Çπ10,00,000
- Monthly revenue (Year 1): ‚Çπ2,00,000
- Monthly revenue (Year 2): ‚Çπ2,50,000
- Monthly revenue (Year 3): ‚Çπ3,00,000
- Fixed costs (monthly): ‚Çπ50,000
- Variable costs (% of revenue): 40%

### Calculation Steps:

**For each month (1-36)**:
1. Calculate revenue (based on year)
2. Calculate variable costs = Revenue √ó 40%
3. Calculate total costs = Fixed costs + Variable costs
4. Calculate profit/loss = Revenue - Total costs
5. Calculate cumulative profit/loss = Previous cumulative + Current profit/loss

**Summary Metrics**:
- **Break-even month**: First month where cumulative profit > 0
- **ROI**: (Total profit after 3 years / Total investment) √ó 100
- **Payback period**: Months until cumulative profit = investment
- **NPV**: Discounted future cash flows

---

## üéØ Government Scheme Matching Logic

### Matching Algorithm:

**Step 1**: Filter schemes by sector
- If business sector = "Food Processing" ‚Üí Show schemes tagged with "Food Processing"

**Step 2**: Filter by investment range
- If investment = ‚Çπ10,00,000 ‚Üí Show schemes with min_investment ‚â§ ‚Çπ10,00,000 AND max_investment ‚â• ‚Çπ10,00,000

**Step 3**: Filter by state
- If state = "Andhra Pradesh" ‚Üí Show schemes eligible in AP

**Step 4**: Rank by subsidy amount
- Sort by `subsidy_percentage` (highest first)

**Step 5**: Return top 10 matches

**Example Output**:
```
1. PMEGP (Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme)
   - Subsidy: 25% (max ‚Çπ2,50,000)
   - Eligible: Manufacturing, All states
   
2. MSME Technology Upgradation Scheme
   - Subsidy: 15% (max ‚Çπ1,50,000)
   - Eligible: Manufacturing, All states
```
