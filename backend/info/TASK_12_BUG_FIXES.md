# Task 12 Testing - Bug Fixes

## Overview
During Task 12 AI generation testing, we discovered pre-existing bugs in the section update endpoints (from Task 9) that caused 500 errors for two sections. These have now been fixed.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Entrepreneur Details - Date Serialization Error

**Section**: `entrepreneur_details`  
**Field**: `date_of_birth`  
**Error**: 500 Internal Server Error when updating section

#### Root Cause
- The Prisma schema defines `dateOfBirth` as `DateTime` type
- The Pydantic model uses Python's `date` type
- The route handler was passing the `date` object directly to Prisma
- Prisma couldn't serialize the `date` object to `DateTime`, causing a 500 error

#### Solution
Modified `update_entrepreneur_section()` in `routes/form.py` to convert `date` to `datetime`:

```python
if data.date_of_birth is not None:
    # Convert date to datetime for Prisma DateTime field
    update_dict["dateOfBirth"] = datetime.combine(data.date_of_birth, datetime.min.time())
```

Applied to both update and create operations.

### 2. Product Details - JSON Field Serialization

**Section**: `product_details`  
**Field**: `key_features`  
**Error**: 500 Internal Server Error when updating section

#### Root Cause
- The Prisma schema defines `keyFeatures` as `Json` type
- The Pydantic model uses `List[str]` type
- Prisma Client Python may not automatically serialize Python lists to JSON strings
- The handler was passing the raw Python list, causing serialization issues

#### Solution
Modified `update_product_section()` in `routes/form.py` to explicitly serialize to JSON:

```python
if data.key_features is not None:
    # Ensure key_features is properly formatted for Prisma JSON field
    update_dict["keyFeatures"] = json.dumps(data.key_features) if isinstance(data.key_features, list) else data.key_features
```

Applied to both update and create operations.

Also added `import json` to the top of the file.

### 3. AI Model Metadata Tracking

**Section**: AI Generation Response  
**Field**: `ai_model_used`  
**Error**: Incorrect model name in response (showed `gemini-1.5-flash` instead of `gemini-2.5-flash`)

#### Root Cause
- The AI service was using `gemini-2.5-flash` model
- But the model name was hardcoded as `"gemini-1.5-flash"` in the database insert
- This caused confusion about which model was actually being used

#### Solution
1. Added `model_name` attribute to `AIService` class to track the model being used
2. Added `get_model_name()` method to retrieve the model name
3. Updated route to use dynamic model name:

```python
# In AIService.__init__()
self.model_name = "gemini-2.5-flash"  # Store model name
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(self.model_name)

# In routes/form.py - generate endpoint
"aiModelUsed": ai_service.get_model_name(),
```

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/utils/ai_service.py` - Added model_name tracking
- `backend/routes/form.py` - Use dynamic model name

---

## Files Modified

1. **backend/routes/form.py**
   - Added `import json` (line 7)
   - Modified `update_entrepreneur_section()` (lines ~680-730)
     - Added datetime conversion for `date_of_birth`
   - Modified `update_product_section()` (lines ~779-829)
     - Added JSON serialization for `key_features`

## Impact

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Entrepreneur Details: 500 error
- ❌ Product Details: 500 error
- ⚠️ AI Generation: Could only use 6/8 form sections for context

### After Fixes
- ✅ Entrepreneur Details: Should work correctly
- ✅ Product Details: Should work correctly
- ✅ AI Generation: Can use all 8 form sections for context

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Re-run Manual Test**:
   ```bash
   python tests/manual_test_ai_generation.py
   ```
   Expected: All 8 sections should populate successfully in Step 4

2. **Verify Date Handling**:
   - Test with various date formats in the string
   - Ensure proper conversion to DateTime in database

3. **Verify JSON Handling**:
   - Test with various array sizes
   - Ensure proper retrieval returns the list correctly
   - Test empty arrays and single-item arrays

4. **End-to-End AI Generation**:
   - With all 8 sections populated, AI generation should produce better quality content
   - Each section generator has access to full form context

## Technical Notes

### Date Conversion
- Uses `datetime.combine(date_obj, datetime.min.time())` to create midnight datetime
- This preserves the date while adding a time component (00:00:00)
- Prisma stores this as a proper DateTime in PostgreSQL

### JSON Serialization
- Uses `json.dumps()` to convert Python list to JSON string
- Includes safety check: `if isinstance(data.key_features, list)`
- On retrieval, Prisma automatically deserializes JSON back to Python list

## Related Tasks

- **Task 9**: Section update endpoints (where bugs originated)
- **Task 10**: Complete form retrieval (first discovered these issues)
- **Task 12**: AI content generation (revealed bugs during testing)

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server to apply changes
2. Re-run the AI generation test
3. Verify all sections populate successfully
4. Test AI generation with full 8-section context
5. Proceed with Task 13 or Task 14 as planned
