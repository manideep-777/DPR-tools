# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement user login API endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the `/auth/login` endpoint in the FastAPI backend to authenticate users and generate JWT tokens upon successful login.
# Details:
Implement the endpoint using FastAPI. Validate user credentials (email and password). Retrieve the user from the database using Prisma. Verify the password using bcrypt. Generate a JWT token containing the user ID and email. Return the token to the frontend.

# Test Strategy:
Send a POST request to `/auth/login` with valid user credentials. Verify that a JWT token is returned upon successful login. Ensure that appropriate error messages are returned for invalid credentials.
