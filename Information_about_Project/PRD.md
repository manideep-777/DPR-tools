## üß† **Problem Statement**

### National Context:
India hosts **7.34 crore MSMEs** generating livelihoods for **11+ crore people** and driving **45.79% of exports** (‚Çπ12.39 lakh crore). Yet, despite this tremendous potential:

- **91% of MSMEs acknowledge AI's importance** for future competitiveness
- **59% are unable to integrate AI** due to high costs, low technical awareness, and limited capabilities
- **Weak/incomplete project documentation** is a primary barrier to credit access
- **Complex compliance requirements** restrict export competitiveness

### Critical Pain Points in Andhra Pradesh:
- **18 lakh registered MSMEs** struggle with DPR preparation
- **75% of MSME loan applications are rejected** due to poor project documentation quality

- **4-6 weeks** average time to prepare a comprehensive DPR
- **Lack of standardization** in DPR formats across different banks
- **Limited awareness** of applicable government schemes and subsidies
- **Digital divide**: Most MSMEs lack access to affordable, AI-powered business tools

### Solution Opportunity:
The Government of India's strategic focus on "overcoming barriers through targeted efforts to foster digital adoption, promote AI-enabled solutions, and drive innovation-driven facilitation" creates a unique opportunity to pilot a nationally scalable solution in Andhra Pradesh.

### Target Impact:
- **Reduce DPR preparation time** from 6 weeks to 2 hours (95% reduction)
- **Cut preparation costs** by 90% (eliminating consultant dependency)
- **Increase loan approval rates** from ~25% to 70%+
- **Enable 500+ MSMEs** to access credit in Phase 1 (AP)
