# Government Schemes Frontend Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds government scheme browsing and AI-powered matching capabilities to the DPR application. The feature integrates with the existing backend AI service to provide intelligent scheme recommendations.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. API Layer (`src/lib/api/schemes.ts`)
- **Purpose**: API client functions for scheme-related endpoints
- **Functions**:
  - `getAllSchemes()`: Fetches all available government schemes
  - `matchSchemes(formId, maxResults)`: Gets AI-powered scheme recommendations for a specific DPR form

### 2. All Schemes Page (`src/app/schemes/page.tsx`)
- **Route**: `/schemes`
- **Purpose**: Browse all available government schemes with filtering capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Search by scheme name, description, or ministry
  - Filter by scheme type (subsidy, loan, grant, training)
  - Filter by sector (manufacturing, services, textile, etc.)
  - View detailed scheme information including:
    - Financial benefits (subsidy percentage, max amount)
    - Investment range requirements
    - Eligible sectors and states
    - Eligibility criteria
    - Direct link to application portal

### 3. AI Scheme Matching Page (`src/app/schemes/ai-match/page.tsx`)
- **Route**: `/schemes/ai-match`
- **Purpose**: Get personalized AI-powered scheme recommendations
- **Key Features**:
  
  #### Form Validation
  - Requires **ALL 8 sections** to be completed:
    1. Entrepreneur Details
    2. Business Details
    3. Product Details
    4. Financial Details
    5. Revenue Assumptions
    6. Cost Details
    7. Staffing Details
    8. Timeline Details
  
  #### Completion Tracking
  - Visual progress bar showing section completion
  - Grid display of all sections with checkmarks
  - Auto-detection of completed sections (supports both snake_case and camelCase)
  - Alert when sections are incomplete
  - Success message when all sections complete
  
  #### AI Matching Process
  - Select from user's existing DPR forms
  - Click "Get AI-Powered Scheme Recommendations" button
  - Backend AI analyzes complete business profile
  - Returns top-matched schemes with:
    - **Match Score**: AI-generated relevance score (0-100)
    - **AI Insight**: Key benefit tailored to the business
    - **Match Reasons**: Specific reasons why scheme fits
    - Detailed scheme information
  
  #### Visual Enhancements
  - Top 3 schemes marked as "Top Pick"
  - Color-coded scheme types
  - Match score prominently displayed
  - AI-generated insights highlighted
  - Direct application links

### 4. Dashboard Updates (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Added**: Government Schemes section in Quick Actions card
- **New Buttons**:
  - **Browse All Schemes**: Navigate to `/schemes` to view all available schemes
  - **AI Suggested Schemes**: Navigate to `/schemes/ai-match` for personalized recommendations

### 5. UI Components
- **Alert Component** (`src/components/ui/alert.tsx`): Created for displaying important messages and notifications

## User Flow

### Browsing All Schemes
1. User clicks "Browse All Schemes" from dashboard
2. Views complete list of government schemes (12 schemes currently)
3. Can filter by type, sector, or search by keywords
4. Clicks "Visit Application Portal" to apply directly

### Getting AI Recommendations
1. User clicks "AI Suggested Schemes" from dashboard
2. Selects a DPR form from dropdown
3. System checks if all 8 sections are completed:
   - **If incomplete**: Shows progress bar, missing sections, and "Complete Form Sections" button
   - **If complete**: Shows green success message and "Get AI-Powered Scheme Recommendations" button
4. User clicks recommendation button
5. Backend AI service analyzes:
   - Entrepreneur profile
   - Business details (sector, location, legal structure)
   - Product information
   - Financial projections
   - Revenue model
   - Cost structure
   - Staffing plan
   - Implementation timeline
6. AI returns top 10 matched schemes with:
   - Intelligent match scores
   - Specific reasons for recommendation
   - Key benefits tailored to the business
7. User reviews recommendations and applies to suitable schemes

## Backend Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/schemes/all`: Fetches all schemes
- `POST /api/schemes/match/{form_id}`: AI-powered scheme matching
  - Request body: `{ "max_results": 10 }`
  - Response includes AI-generated scores, reasons, and key benefits

### Required Form Data
For AI matching to work, the form must have data in all these tables:
- `EntrepreneurDetails`
- `BusinessDetails` (required)
- `ProductDetails`
- `FinancialDetails` (required for scoring)
- `RevenueAssumptions`
- `CostDetails`
- `StaffingDetails`
- `TimelineDetails`

The backend validates that `BusinessDetails` exists before attempting matching.

## AI Matching Algorithm (Backend)

The backend uses Google Gemini AI with:
1. **Comprehensive Business Context**: All 8 sections of form data
2. **Scheme Summary**: All available schemes with details
3. **AI Prompt**: Requests top N schemes with JSON response:
   ```json
   [{
     "scheme_number": 1,
     "match_score": 95,
     "reasons": ["Specific reason 1", "Specific reason 2"],
     "key_benefit": "Tailored benefit description"
   }]
   ```
4. **Fallback**: If AI fails, uses rule-based scoring (sector + state + investment matching)

## Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Subsidy**: Green
- **Loan**: Blue
- **Grant**: Purple
- **Training**: Orange

### Status Indicators
- **Top Pick Badge**: Yellow (for top 3 AI matches)
- **Completed Sections**: Green checkmark
- **Incomplete Sections**: Gray circle outline
- **AI Insights**: Blue alert box
- **Financial Benefits**: Green info box
