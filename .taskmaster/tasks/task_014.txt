# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement financial projections calculation API endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the `/financial/calculate/{form_id}` (POST) endpoint in the FastAPI backend to calculate financial projections based on the form data.
# Details:
Implement the endpoint using FastAPI. Retrieve the form data. Perform the financial calculations as described in the PRD (revenue projections, cost analysis, profit/loss, ROI, break-even, etc.). Store the projections in the `financial_projections` and `financial_summary` tables. Return a success message or error if calculation fails.

# Test Strategy:
Send a POST request to `/financial/calculate/{form_id}` with a valid JWT token. Verify that the financial projections are calculated correctly and stored in the database.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement FastAPI endpoint for financial calculations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the `/financial/calculate/{form_id}` (POST) endpoint using FastAPI to handle financial projection requests.
### Details:
Define the route, request body, and response structure. Implement JWT authentication middleware to protect the endpoint. Handle potential errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

## 2. Retrieve form data from the database [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Retrieve the DPR form data from the database based on the provided `form_id`.
### Details:
Use Prisma to query the `dpr_forms` table and retrieve the form data. Handle cases where the form does not exist or the user does not have permission to access it.

## 3. Perform revenue projections [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Calculate revenue projections based on the retrieved form data and the PRD specifications.
### Details:
Implement the revenue projection calculations as described in the PRD. Consider different revenue streams, growth rates, and market conditions. Ensure the calculations are accurate and well-documented.

## 4. Perform cost analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Analyze the costs associated with the project based on the retrieved form data and the PRD specifications.
### Details:
Implement the cost analysis calculations as described in the PRD. Consider fixed costs, variable costs, and other relevant expenses. Ensure the calculations are accurate and well-documented.

## 5. Calculate profit/loss, ROI, and break-even point [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Calculate profit/loss, return on investment (ROI), and break-even point based on the revenue projections and cost analysis.
### Details:
Implement the calculations for profit/loss, ROI, and break-even point using the results of the revenue projections and cost analysis. Ensure the calculations are accurate and well-documented.

## 6. Store financial projections in the database [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Store the calculated financial projections in the `financial_projections` and `financial_summary` tables.
### Details:
Use Prisma to insert the calculated financial projections into the `financial_projections` and `financial_summary` tables. Ensure that the data is stored correctly and that the database schema is properly defined.
